Game Layout:
Player must collect all ingrediants to win the game. Order doesn't matter. Most ingrediants are won by answering riddles.

Movement is oriented in four directions, with the option to return to previous location and reverse steps available at almost every point.

First location is the kitchen, in which the player can 'take' a recipe book and the first ingredient, [flour]. Checking the recipe book at any point provides a list of which ingredients the player has and still needs. Moving forward results in falling down the rabbit hole, and then the underground hallway. Once in the hallway, player cannot return to the rabbit hole. Player has the choice to access the river of tears to the left [butter] or the garden to the right. Once in the garden, player can move left or right to the tea party or caterpillar. Both of these locations have associated riddles where the player can win [sugar] and [mushrooms], respectively. Traversing forward from the tea party brings the player to the Queen's rose bushes, where they can gather [roses]. Finally, moving forward again takes the player to the Queen's croquet game, where answering a final riddle wins [eggs]. At that point, the player has gathered all ingredients and wins the game. 

Challenges:
- Make sure to take the flour and the recipe book in the house. You won't have another chance.
- Initially, the player is too large to enter the door to the garden in the hallway. Player must 'take' and 'eat' the EAT ME pie available in the hallway. Once shrunken, try the door again.
- The answer to the caterpillar riddle is "time".
- The answer to the tea party riddle is "school".
- The answer to the croquet game riddle is "maid".
